Here is the refined, "Mega Prompt" tailored for Base44. I have consolidated all your requests, resolved the conflicting design instructions (moving from "Cyberpunk" to "Anthropic/Google Minimal"), and structured it for maximum technical performance to prevent lag.

---

### **Copy and Paste the text below into Base44:**

**Role:**
You are a Lead Frontend Architect and Design Systems Expert at a top-tier Silicon Valley research lab. You are tasked with building a landing page for **Anveshan**, an AI project.

**Design Philosophy (Crucial Overhaul):**

* **Visual Reference:** Mimic the aesthetic of **Anthropic.com** or **Google DeepMind**.
* **Vibe:** Classy, Academic, Minimal, High-Value.
* **Tone:** Humble confidence. Do not "boast" or use loud colors. The design should feel like a whitepaper come to life—clean typography, plenty of whitespace, and subtle, sophisticated interactions.
* **Color Palette:** Move away from neon cyberpunk. Use sophisticated "Off-Black" (`#111111`), "Warm Charcoal," and "Paper White." Accents should be subtle earth tones or soft serif-style blues.

**Performance Requirement (Strict):**

* **Zero Lag:** The previous iteration was laggy. You must optimize for performance.
* **Virtualization:** Ensure animations only trigger when elements are in the viewport.
* **Optimization:** Use lightweight SVG icons and optimized Framer Motion variants (`will-change: transform`).

### **Tech Stack & Implementation**

* **Framework:** React + Vite + TypeScript.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Focus on typography and spacing).
* **Motion:** Framer Motion (Smooth, slow, heavily damped springs. No jerky movements).
* **Fonts:** Use a high-end serif for Headings (like 'Merriweather' or 'Playfair Display') and a clean sans-serif for body (like 'Inter' or 'Geist Sans') to mimic the Anthropic research feel.

### **Page Structure & Detailed Content**

#### **1. Navbar (Minimalist)**

* **Logo:** No icon. Just the text.
* **Text:** Write the project name in Sanskrit/Devanagari script: **"अन्वेषण"** followed by "Anveshan" in English in a smaller, lighter font weight.
* **Right Side:** Minimal text links.

#### **2. Hero Section (The "Research" Look)**

* **Layout:** Clean, centered, or split with plenty of breathing room.
* **Headline:** "The Future of Identity Verification."
* **Sub-headline:** "An intelligent AI system for automated face verification and de-duplication. Built specifically for the IndiaAI Face Authentication Challenge 2025."
* **Achievements (Subtle):** Display these facts elegantly (small text, perhaps separated by dots, not big loud badges):
* *AIR 23 - IndiaAI Hackathon 2025*
* *State Rank 2*
* *79% CPU Accuracy*


* **Action Buttons:**
1. **Primary (Classy Solid):** "Download Alpha v2.0" -> Link: `https://github.com/metalheadshubham/Anveshan/archive/refs/heads/v2.0-release.zip`
2. **Secondary (Subtle Text Link/Outline):** "View Source" -> Link: `https://github.com/metalheadshubham/Anveshan`



#### **3. Architecture Map (Visual Diagram)**

* Create a clean, schematic diagram using CSS/SVG shapes (lines connecting nodes) that explains the flow:
* *Input Folder -> Tier 0 (MD5) -> Tier 3 (InsightFace) -> Verified Output.*


* This should look like a technical diagram in a scientific paper.

#### **4. The "How" (Interactive Timeline)**

* A smooth scrolling timeline explaining the Multi-Tier Detection.
* **Tiers:**
* Tier 0: Instant Hash (MD5)
* Tier 1: Perceptual Hash
* Tier 2: Near-Duplicate
* Tier 3: AI Face Recognition (InsightFace - CUDA/TTA)
* Tier 4: Visual Features (ORB)


* **Interaction:** As the user scrolls, the active tier highlights softly.

#### **5. Technical Deep Dive (Wide & Mathematical)**

* **Layout:** Full-width container, very clean.
* **Content:** Display the Mathematical Foundation.
* **Formatting:** Use beautiful, wide LaTeX rendering for formulas (Perceptual Hashing & ArcFace Embeddings). Ensure adequate padding so the math "breathes."

#### **6. Bento Grid (Stats)**

* A minimalist grid (thin borders, light background) showing:
* 12,712 Lines of Code.
* 90+ Hours of Development.
* GPU Ready (CUDA optimized).
* Processing Speed: 4,000 images in 16-20 mins.



#### **7. Developer Section (Personal & Quirky)**

* **Style:** Minimal text block, no profile picture placeholder.
* **Name:** Shubham Kumar.
* **Bio:** "16-Year-Old Solo Developer."
* **Quote:** "I like to study physics and code, also I like bulbula."
* **Links:** Github and Email (minimal icons).

#### **8. Footer**

* Copyright 2025 Anveshan Project.
* "Made with ❤️ in Uttar Pradesh, India."

### **Specific Instructions for Base44:**

1. **Smooth Scrolling:** Implement a global smooth scroll wrapper (like Lenis or similar) for a premium feel.
2. **Lag Prevention:** Do not render heavy background particle effects. Use subtle CSS gradients or noise textures instead.
3. **Consistency:** Ensure the padding and margins are consistent with a high-end design system (8pt grid).
4. **Links:** Double-check that the Download button triggers the specific `.zip` link provided above.

**Action:** Generate the complete, high-performance, Anthropic-style landing page code now.
